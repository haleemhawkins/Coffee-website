 ### Description:

This is my first functional website promoting some amazing coffee shops and my love for coffee! 

I developed this using HTML and CSS. 

This was a school project but the idea and look of the website was left completely up to me. 

Later on, I have been consistantly updating the user interface of the page to create a pleasing aesthetic.

Thank you for viewing!

### Lessons Learned:
 * Designing with Figma is essential.
 * Design the web and mobile version of the site on figma. 
 * Next time, I would like to use either CSS grid or flexbox layouts for styling.
 * I also need to start studying/recreating current design trends to improve my eye for design.
